# Section-Collapse
A simple swift project showing how one can collapse and expand the sections of a UITableView using custom view for section header( with UI customisation such as gradient), added programatically.

## Motivation

iOS framework provides great customisations with UITableView. This is a really simple example of how we can make a section collapse and expand using UITableView.

Added a simple gradinent programatically to give it a nice look!
